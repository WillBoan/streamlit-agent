Required Notice Period:
Your section 21 notice won’t be valid if you haven’t been given enough notice. The amount of notice you should get will depend on when you got your section 21 notice.
If you got your section 21 notice on or after 1 October 2021, your landlord should have given you 2 months’ notice.
If you got your section 21 notice before 26 March 2020, your landlord should have given you 2 months' notice. 
If you got the notice between 26 March and 28 August 2020, your landlord had to give you 3 months’ notice.
If you got the notice between 29 August 2020 and 31 May 2021, your landlord had to give you 6 months’ notice.
If you got the notice between 1 June and 30 September 2021, your landlord had to give you 4 months’ notice (or if you had a periodic tenancy with a period of 6 months or more, your landlord had to give you 6 months’ notice).
If your landlord hasn’t given you enough notice period, your section 21 notice isn’t valid.
