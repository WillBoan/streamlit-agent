Retaliatory Eviction: If you're being evicted because you've complained or asked for repairs:
There are extra rules that might protect you from being evicted if you've complained to your landlord or asked for repairs.
Your landlord has to keep your home in a good condition and do repairs if you need them.
They can’t make you leave your home just for asking for repairs to be done - your landlord has to follow a proper eviction process if they want you to leave.
If your landlord tries to evict you because you asked for repairs this is known as ‘retaliatory eviction’. You might be able to challenge a retaliatory eviction.
